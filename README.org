#+TITLE:  GPU Accelerated Python 3 Kernel for Optimus-Nvidia GPUs

This small hack enables an easy way to switch to GPU accelerated hardware with
Nvidia's Optimus hardware. This gear can be found in laptops where two
different GPUs are provided: an integrated Intel GPU and a dedicated, more
powerful Nvidia GPU. These provides a less powerful, efficient GPU for normal
use and a more capable and energy-demanding one.

Although Windows takes care of this by itself, GNU/Linux systems usually
require greater configuration to work. A common alternative is to use
=bbswitch= and =bumblebee=, which allow seamless switching between cards when
properly configured. These utilities provide the =optirun= command, which turns
on and off the dedicated GPU just for the command that is being invoked into.
For that reason, using Jupyter notebooks with the Nvidia GPU can be achieved by
running =optirun jupyter notebook=. However, this requires the server to be
completely restarted if GPU usage is required. On the other hand, running this
command every time can be produce increased battery consumption even if it is
not needed.

For that reason, this kernel can provide an easier way and better granularity
for notebooks. To install this kernel, locate your kernel folder (in my case,
it is inside my Anaconda installation) and copy the folder provided in this
repository.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ git clone https://github.com/DiegoVicen/gpu-python3-kernel.git
$ cp gpu-python3-kernel/optirun_python3 <anaconda>/share/jupyter/kernels/
#+END_SRC

This should be enough configuration to enable a Jupyter Kernel with GPU support
that can be assigned to certain notebooks and provide seamless execution while
minimizing the power consumption. You can check if it has been correctly
installed by running this command:

#+BEGIN_SRC
$ jupyter kernelspec list
Available kernels:
  optirun_python3    <anaconda>/jupyter/kernels/optirun_python3
  python3            <anaconda>/jupyter/kernels/python3
#+END_SRC

And then selecting the kernel "Python 3 [GPU]" in the notebook once it is
necessary.

This is a hacky solution and probably not a general enough one: some
modification on your side may be required to adapt it to your requirements.
